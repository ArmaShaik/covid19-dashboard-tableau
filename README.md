# Data Visualization: COVID-19 Dashboard Using Tableau

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard built to explore global and U.S. COVID-19 trends from January 21, 2020 to April 29, 2022. Using publicly available datasets, the dashboard highlights total positive cases, new daily case trends, and regional impact through spatial and time-series visualizations. The objective was to apply dashboard design principles and visual storytelling to uncover actionable insights.

## 🌐 Project Context

This dashboard explores how COVID-19 cases evolved globally and across U.S. states using real-world data. The goal was to uncover spatial patterns, time trends, and high-impact regions through intuitive dashboards and visual storytelling.


The dataset is sourced from the **Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub**, focusing on:
- Total positive cases
- Death counts
- New case spikes
- U.S. state-wise trends

2. Which U.S. states were most impacted, and how did their trends evolve?  
3. What were the new daily case surges across regions?  
4. Can spatial patterns be detected using map-based visualizations?

## 📍 Key Observations

- The **United States** led in both total cases and death counts.  
- **India** and **Brazil** followed, but with significantly different death-to-case ratios.  
- **California, Florida, and Texas** had the highest new case counts among U.S. states.  
- Time-series analysis revealed **multiple surges**, including the Omicron spike in late 2021.
